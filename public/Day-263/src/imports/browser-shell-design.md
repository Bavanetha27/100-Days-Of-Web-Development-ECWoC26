Prompt: Custom Shell in Browser

Design a modern web-based terminal interface UI titled “Custom Shell in Browser.” The application should simulate a command-line shell directly inside the browser, allowing users to type commands, view output, manage files, and interact with a virtual system. The design should feel similar to Linux terminals, VS Code integrated terminal, or cloud shell interfaces, with a clean and developer-focused layout.
